# Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)

According to the World Health Organization (WHO/OMS):
  >...serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. People with it are often not able to do their usual activities and, at times, may be confined to bed.


In medical practices since 1988, it's also called **Myalgic encephalomyelitis** (ME).

--- 

First defined by the USA Center for Disease Control  (Holmes et al., 1988).

The revision of Fukuda et al. (1994) is most frequently used.

## Fukuda's case definition

A case of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome has:

- **Persistent or relapsing fatigue for 6 or more months**.

- With at least 4 out of:
  
  - Sore throat;
  - Muscle pain;
  - Joint pain;
  - Headaches;
  - Tender lymph nodes;
  - Unrefreshing sleep;
  - Memory or concentration impairment;
  - Post-extertional malaise*****.

.footnote[[*****] Criticized by not demanding this important symptom (Williams et al., 2014)].

# Importance of CFS

It's a relatively common disorder:

- 410 cases per 100.000 Americans (Jason et al., 1999);
  - Estimate of 1 million cases in EUA alone;


- 850.000 Americans according to Jason e Njoku (2006).

- 857/100.000 estimating 2.8 million Americans (Valdez et al., 2019).

CFS affects children's life quality **as much as Asthma and Type I Diabetes Mellitus** (Kennedy et al., 2010).

Therefore, interferes in the individual's:

  - Health condition;
  - Social and professional lives.

background-size: 150px 150px

# CFS factors

The definition of the CFS factors is an ongoing effort.

The ones with most evidence are:

- Irregular sleep (Samaha et al., 2007);

- Psychological stress (Servaes et al., 2002; Nagy-Szakal et al., 2018);

- Nutrient deficiency (Naviaux et al., 2018);

- Cholesterol abnormalities (Bjørklund et al., 2019);

- Hormonal and Immunological dysfunctions (Sotzny et al., 2018);

- Infections (Litleskare et al., 2018).
 
---

# Other conditions

There is also evidence of relation with other conditions:

- **Neurally-mediated hypotension** (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995).
  
  - Sodium-based treatment reduced the severity in some individuals.
<br><br>
- **Metabolic Syndrome** (Maloney et al., 2010).

  - Includes high levels of glucose and abnormal cholesterol.
<br><br>
- Elevated risk after 10 years of **Giardia infection** (Litleskare et al., 2018).
  
  - Ratio of 2.22 to 4.08 as compared to control cases.

# CFS Prevention

Given the ongoing search for factors, statistical models are progressing on the prevention:
<br><br>

- **Nayve Bayes** obtained **AUC of 0.70** on gene expression data (Huang et al., 2007).
<br><br><br>
- Servaes et al. (2002) studied CFS in breast-cancer individuals with **linear models**.
  - Found evidence of physical, psychologic and cognitive factors.
<br><br><br>
- By **decision trees** on medical survey data, Bronikowski et al. (2011) obtained **accuracy of 71.88%**.

# The data we had

Cross-sectional study on 621 off-road truck drivers in a **mine**.
  
The individuals worked on **alternated shifts**: 6hrs shifts and 12hrs of rest.

From the project: **Síndrome Metabólica em Trabalhadores de Mineração em MG**.

--- 

The measured variables were:

 - **Absenteeism**: Was there any ocurrence in the year?
 
 - 11 biochemical;
 
 - 8 anthropometric;
 
 - 2 socio-demographic.

# CFS and shifts

Shift work systems disrupt circadian cycles, leading to **shift-lag**:

- Fatigue, sleepiness and insomnia;

- Irritability;

- Impairment of mental agility;

according to Costa (2010), all factors of CFS.

**Shift frequency** is positively correlated with **CFS severity** (Shen et al., 2005).

# CFS and shifts on mines

The mining industry is characterized by:

- Risky work conditions;
	
- High psychological stress;

which, together with shift work, increases the risk of CFS.
<br><br>

CFS increases the risk of fatal accidents in risky environments.
<br><br>

Fatigue is positively correlated with perilous driving (Useche et al., 2017).

# CFS and absenteeism

According to Colquhoun e Senn (2000), shift workers constantly complain of:

- Irritability;

- Anxiety;

- Stressful work conditions.

--- 

Shift work on mines may lead not only to CFS but also:

  - Neuroticism;
  
  - Chronic anxiety/Depression;
  
resulting in **higher risk of absenteeism and need for psychotropic drugs** (Nakata et al (2004).

# The approach

## Statistical methodology and Software

---

## Objectives

In this context, we aimed to:

- Study the relation of the variables with absenteeism;

- Search for similar relations in the literature for CFS.

--

## Pre-processing

Removal of variables with more than 15% missing.

Imputation of missing data with missForest (Random Forests Imputation):
  - Prediction of missing values with **Random Forests**;
  
  - Outperformed KNN, bPCA and MICE in simulations (Waljee et al., 2013) 

The remaining variables were then **standardized**.


---

# Logistic regression

The Logistic model was used with 3 approaches:

  - **Stepwise**: variable selection;
  
  - **Elastic-Net** and **Lasso**: variable selection and regularization.
  
--- 

The Elastic-Net penalizes the Resiadual Sum of Squares (RSS):

$$RSS + \lambda(\frac{1-\alpha}{2}\sum\hat{\beta_j^2} + \alpha\sum|\hat{\beta_j}|)$$

shrinking $\hat{\beta}$ according to $\lambda$ and $\alpha$. When $\alpha = 1$ it becomes the Lasso.

According to Pavlou et al. (2015), it reduces bias introduced when the Events Per Variable (EPV) are less than 10. **Our EPV is 8.69**. 

---

# Model selection

Both Stepwise and Elastic-Net need to select the best models:

  - Stepwise: Find the best subset of variables at each iteration;
  
  - Elastic-Net: Find $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ for the best model performance.

<br>
**Cross Validation 10-fold** was used with:

  - **Stratification**: Garanteeing class balance in all folds.
  
  - **10 repetitions**: Reducing variability due to fold randomization;

<br>
The used metric was the **Area Under the ROC curve (AUC)**: Values close to 1 indicate better class discrimination, as opposed to values close to 0.5.

---

## Variability assessment: 90% Confidence Intervals

For the coefficients, the **classical Bootstrap**:
  - Resample $n$ observations with replacement and fit the model.
  
  - Repeat $B$ times to obtain the empirical distribution of coefficients.
  
--- 

The metrics of **Accuracy**, **Sensitivity** and **Specificity** were assessed by the **Bootstrap 632** (Efron and Tibshirani, 1997):

  - Perform classical bootstrap and obtain performance $P_{train}$;
  
  - Obtain $P_{test}$ from the unsampled observations.
  
  - Combine them $P_{632} = 0.632 \times P_{train} + 0.368 \times P_{test}$.

## Software and packages

The analysis was made in the **R Language** (v3.5.1) using the RStudio IDE (v1.3.125).

<br>
The mainly used packages were:

  - `caret`: Model fitting and selection;
  
  - `ggplot2`: For visualizations;
  
  - `missForest`: Missing data imputation;
  
  - `tibble`, `tidyr` and `dplyr`: Data manipulation and cleaning;
  
  - `purrr` and `furrr`: Easily iterate and parallel processing.

# Variable effects

The literature shows similar effects for CFS and Absenteeism:

  - Positively correlated with the risk:
  
    - **Trigycerides**: De Lorenzo et al. (1998)
    
    - **LDL Cholesterol**: Tomic et al. (2012);

  - Negatively correlated with the risk:
  
    - **Sodium**: Rowe and Calkins (1998); Comhaire (2015);
    
    - **Total Cholesterol**: Tomic et al. (2012);
    
    - **HDL Cholesterol**: De Lorenzo et al. (1998)
    
    - **Potassium**: No evidence of relation with CFS (Lerner et al., 1997).

## Model performance

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=470, out.width=600, fig.align='center', dpi=300}
#knitr::include_graphics("images/PerfModels.png")

plot_boot <- mutate(bootStepImp, Model = "Stepwise") %>% 
  bind_rows(mutate(bootLassoImp, Model = "Lasso")) %>% 
  bind_rows(mutate(bootElnetImp, Model = "Elastic-Net")) %>% 
  select(Model, ACC, SNS, SPC) %>% 
  gather(-Model, key = "Measure", value = "Estimate") %>% 
  mutate(Model = factor(Model, levels = c("Stepwise", "Lasso", "Elastic-Net")),
         Measure = factor(Measure, levels = c("ACC", "SNS", "SPC")))

plot_boot_ci <- plot_boot %>% group_by(Measure, Model) %>% 
  summarise(LInf = quantile(Estimate, 0.05, na.rm = T),
            LSup = quantile(Estimate, 0.95, na.rm = T),
            Estimate = mean(Estimate, na.rm = T))

ggplot(plot_boot, aes(x = Measure, y = Estimate)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Model), color = FALSE, alpha = 0.4) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(x = Measure, y = Estimate, ymin = LInf, ymax = LSup, group = Model), 
                  data = plot_boot_ci, position = position_dodge(width = 0.905), size = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Measure, y = Val, label = round(Val, 2), group = Model, hjust = -0.075), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), size = 5.5,
            data = plot_boot_ci %>% gather(-Measure, -Model, key = "Pos", value = "Val")) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.50, linetype = 3, size = 1) + 
  labs(x = " ", y = NULL, fill = NULL) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() + scale_color_viridis_d() + 
  ggpubr::theme_pubr() + theme(text = element_text(size = 21), 
                               axis.text.y = element_text(size = 18))
```

The performance was **no different from random guessing** for all models.

# Conclusion

Models did not discriminate very well.

More detailed studies are needed, i.e., longitudinal studies directly measuring CFS.
